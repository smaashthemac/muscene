# Muscene

Muscene is an app that makes it easy to find upcoming events from artists that are similar to the ones you love. Enter your location and a favorite artist. You'll be shown an image, bio, and the top rated song for the searched artist, as well as a few artists that are similar. You can choose to select one, a few, or all of the artists â€” when you do, you'll see when those artists are playing upcoming shows near you.

This project was created as a group assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
